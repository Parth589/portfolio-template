# portfolio-template

### This is now a first working version of this repositery :)

## Description for those who dont know

**_Long time ago, i got a project to make a portfolio website. at that time i don't know the backend so i decided to make it only in frontend. So i followed [this](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1119177547264048236) design and made this static site.Hope you will like it._**

## Points to be noted if you want to use this code as a template

- You need to modify the [info.json](/js/info.json) file placed in
  **[JS](/js/)** folder üìÅ.
- Almost every proprty in that [info.json](/js/info.json) file is understandable üí°.
- Every proprty has an example link or content. make sure you modify them according to your need.
- The contact me section may not work for every user especially for chrome users. So keep that in mind and if you were able to fix that, let me know in issues section.

## Checkout [this](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1119177547264048236) design from where i took the inspiration and some assets too.
